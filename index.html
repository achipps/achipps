        <h2> Problem statement: Nutrition Labels with Screen Readers</h2>
        <p>
          For the blind and visually impaired, nutrition labels are not only difficult to access, 
          but also cumbersome to navigate in their current format even when they are able to be located 
          and read through accessibility tools such as screen readers.
