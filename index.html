        <h2> Problem statement: Nutrition Labels with Screen Readers</h2>
        <p>
          For the blind and visually impaired, nutrition labels are not only difficult to access, 
          but also cumbersome to navigate in their current format even when they are able to be located 
          and read through accessibility tools such as screen readers.

        </h2></a>
        <p>
          Our affinity diagram gives details about how we want to go about having screen readers be able to 
          process and format nutrition labels in a way that is not just a bunch of information being read. 
          Included are many features that we believe are important as well as accessibility considerations.
