        <h2> Problem statement: Nutrition Labels with Screen Readers</h2>
        <p>
          For the blind and visually impaired, nutrition labels are not only difficult to access, 
          but also cumbersome to navigate in their current format even when they are able to be located 
          and read through accessibility tools such as screen readers.

        </h2></a>
        <p>
          Our affinity diagram gives details about how we want to go about having screen readers be able to 
          process and format nutrition labels in a way that is not just a bunch of information being read. 
          Included are many features that we believe are important as well as accessibility considerations.

        <p>
          My storyboard is about Keith Cooper who is heading over to Publix to pick up a meal for lunch. He cares 
          a lot about his health and needs to know what is in the food he eats. With the app he is to scan the barcode 
          since he struggle to read the tiny print. He can change the speed of the information being read as well as pick out 
          the information he wants to hear.
